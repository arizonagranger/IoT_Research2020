IoT research with Dr. Kun Suo-Spring2020

Comparison of different IoT devices while running Ai-benchmark and MLmark tests. My part of the research was with a Nvidia Jetson TX2 running ai-benchmark. I tracked mainly memory and CPU utilization with nmon, nmonchart, nmonanalyzer, and gnuplot. Running several benchmark tests showed they were consistent each time they were run.
